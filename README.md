Website Re-Boot for client currently on Wix and wishing to move off (scalability issues). Only tracking WP Theme build, no need to track WP core.

##Mission:
To first, re-establish their current Wix designed website as a fully active and custom WordPress Theme. Creating a mobile-first experience for the customers that they currently do not receive.

##Purpose
To provide my client with complete editorial control over their own website, which, they currently do not have. Re code and move away from Wix to be able to better cater to clients needs. Fixing amateur design mistakes like images with text... lots of text. Re-establish my clients presence on the web with a high performance website that is scale-able, not static as is currently the case. 

Wix apparently has some way of blocking the Way Back Machine, otherwise I would post a archival link here. After client site is complete, I will revisit codebase and clean up for distribution.
